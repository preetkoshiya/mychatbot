***************************
A Working ChatBot on the topic: Restaurant 

Chatbot has frontend made using React JS and HTML and it is designed using CSS.
The backend of the project is made using Node JS and Socket IO is used to establish connection.

Backend also contains a file named response.js which contains responses for different inputs from user.
For now, it performs basic tasks such as greeting, showing menu, taking orders but we can add many more functions very easily.
It is developed so that we can easily extend the database of Bot without altering any code at all by simply feeding more data to response.js file.


Prerequisite: Make sure you have already installed required packages like "npm" and "nodemon" to run the project. If not, then please do so.

Offline Installtion Steps (After extracting 'ITChatbot' zip file):
	1. Go to socket-backend and open terminal with administrator's permissions(run as administrator) there.
	
	2. run "nodemon start" OR "nodemon ./index.js" command		##This will start a server at port 8000. Leave it as it is.
	NOTE: Install nodemon using 'npm install -g nodemon' command before running above command.
	
	3. Leave socket-backend termial open as it is and then go to react-frontend folder
	
	4. Now open another terminal in react-frontend folder with administrator's permissions(run as administrator).
	
	5. run 'npm install' to automatically install all the required packages.
	
	6. now run 'npm start' command in the same terminal		##This will start a client and you will be redirected to your respective browser.
